# BackTo
*BackTo is a short game about a cube looking for his spaceship*



BackTo was my first game, and I'm very proud of it cause I've done it all by myself!

It was done for the Minijam 54: Memories, on May 2020



If you want to play, you can have it on browser clicking [HERE](https://mich4.itch.io/backto)!

Or you can get the .exe inside "Build" folder!

I hope you like it!
